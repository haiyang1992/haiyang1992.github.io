### Research Interests
My research focuses on building high-performance and energy-efficient computing systems using photonics. To realized the promised benefits that photonic interconnects and emerging photonic memory devices, I try to redesign several aspects across the entire system stack. The goal is to lay the groundwork for realizable designs that can be quickly adapted in real life.
