I love basketball, both playing and watching. I have been a LeBron James fan since 2006.

I am an active lover for indie, alternative, and post rock. Some of my favorite singers and bands are: Death Cab for Cutie, Kent, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, Mogwai, Pet Shop Boys, God is an Astronaut, and Jeff Buckley

My favorite book and movie are both ***The Lord of the Rings*** by J.R.R. Tolkien. I've recently started on the Wuxia() series by Jin Yong(). Though my progress is slow, I hope to finish them by the time I graduate.

Places I have lived for at least a few months: Evanston, IL; Hong Kong; Beijing, China; Philadephia, PA; New York City, NY; and finally my beloved hometown Xinzhou, China.
